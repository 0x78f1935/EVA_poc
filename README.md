# EVA_poc
Hello, this is EVA. your personal webcam security.
Eva is designed to work with a single webcam.
She can detect motion, save motion detected frames to drive and she supports a live view.
This way you can still watch your webcam on your computer.
You need python for this to work. My python 3 alias is "python3"
```
python3 core.py
```
Q = quit,
Spacebar = manual take a picture
